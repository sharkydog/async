## Abstract and helper classes for asynchronous PHP execution

For now this is only useful with parallel extension, unless you can run closures in separate process/thread.
So docs and examples will go to the repo bellow.

This repo is mostly to hold classes like Pool and Results in separate namespace.

See [sharkydog/async-parallel](https://github.com/sharkydog/async-parallel)
for implementation of PHP parallel extension (requires PHP ZTS).
